## Created and tested by JakeNology on 03/23/2018. 
## Deployable via macOS Server, Centrify, JumpCloud, Casper Suite/Jamf Pro as a Policy and other MDM solutions.
# Note that the ".sh" file extension is not needed as long as the shebang is on top (the interpreter), however it is needed in all JAMF solutions.
# Using the which command, the paths were specified as this script may fail when deployed via Casper Suite/Jamf Pro.
# In the event that this script fails via Self Service, you may need to find another way to run it as the logged in user via Jamf Nation.

# Store the current user's username as a variable
currentuser=`stat -f "%Su" /dev/console`

# Reset the Dock
/usr/bin/sudo -u $currentuser /usr/bin/defaults delete com.apple.dock
